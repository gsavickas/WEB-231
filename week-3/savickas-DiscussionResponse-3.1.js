;====================*/

// Start Program

/*
    Expected Output:

    Iteration #1: i = 0
    Iteration #2: i = 1
    Iteration #3: i = 2
    Iteration #4: i = 3
    Iteration #5: i = 4
    Iteration #6: i = 5
    Iteration #7: i = 6
    Iteration #8: i = 7
    Iteration #9: i = 8
    Iteration #10: i = 9
*/

// Loop
// Logs the current iteration # and the value of i during that iteration
// Corrected for statement does not contain an iterator value in the for statement "i++"
// Corrected , let i = 0 because the proper syntax is a " ; "
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  // Output
  console.log("Iteration #" + (i+1) + ": i = " + i);
}

// End Program
